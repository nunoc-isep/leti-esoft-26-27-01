# OO Analysis

The construction process of the domain model is based on the client specifications, especially the nouns (for _concepts_) and verbs (for _relations_) used. 

## Rationale to identify domain conceptual classes
To identify domain conceptual classes, start by making a list of candidate conceptual classes inspired by the list of categories suggested in the book "Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development". 


### _Conceptual Class Category List_

## Rationale to identify associations between conceptual classes

An association is a relationship between instances of objects that indicates a relevant connection and that is worth of remembering, or it is derivable from the List of Common Associations: 

- **_A_** is physically or logically part of **_B_**
- **_A_** is physically or logically contained in/on **_B_**
- **_A_** is a description for **_B_**
- **_A_** is known/logged/recorded/reported/captured in **_B_**
- **_A_** uses or manages or owns **_B_**
- **_A_** is related with a transaction (item) of **_B_**
- etc.


| Concept (A) 		           | Association   	 | Concept (B) |
|------------------------|:--------------:|------------:|
| Person  	               | registered in  | JoeProfiles |
| Person  	               |    defines     |        Task |
| Task  	                 | categorized in |    Category |
| System Administrator  	 |   maintains    |    Category |
